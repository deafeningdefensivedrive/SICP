## Computer science is a terrible name. First, it's not a science. And it's also not about computers.
"Computer Science" = Process

Process is directed by a Procedure

The language we'll use for the Procedure is Scheme

# Techniques for controlling complexity

## Black-Box Abstraction
    
ex:

    36->|To Find SQRT of X|->6
    
The SQRT of A plus the SQRT of B

    A->|SQRT|\
               +->
    B->|SQRT|/
